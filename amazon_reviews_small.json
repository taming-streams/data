It was clear to me that everyone in it was embarrassed to give voice to the pathetic script. What made it unwatchable for me is the fact that the 100% brain use nonsense was completely debunked 20-30 years ago. Why build a movie around such a widely known false precept? While I've grown used to seeing &#34;anything for a buck&#34; Freeman in bombs, Johansson is new to the game. The look on her face throughout was one of &#34;how did I ever let my agent talk me into this&#34; piece of crap. She's strong enough to recover but the film would have been a career ender for an unknown. Choi Min-shik's world class villainous talents were a total waste here as well. The visuals are a hodgepodge ripoff of everything from E.T. thru to about 15 other films and the special effects rated a 2 on the 0-10 scale. Sorry, nothing redeemable here to me. Find something else to watch. Unless you just want to turn off the sound and fantasize over starring next to Johansson. The most beautiful woman in film today, imo.","review_date":1421515664000}

And while the scene in question was, umm, intense (this is NOT a kids movie), Bonet, Mickey Rourke and Robert DeNiro were fantastic.In the spirit of the hard boiled detective movie, Rourke (who rocks as a 20s-era private eye) is contracted by DeNiro to find someone who owes him named Johnny Favorite - a musician.  This leads Rourke to New Orleans where he runs face first into voodoo and Lisa Bonet as a voodoo priestess - which she just nails while being beautiful and very charming in her own unique way.  The movie descends rapidly into the creepiest bunch of happenings and deaths you've ever seen which seems to dog Rourkes tail.  I won't ruin it for you, but DeNiro just creeped me out more and more throughout the movie and with good reason.  Just a superb movie that messes with you throughout.","review_date":1420310795000}

Fortunately, the discs are not scratched, but as there are 5 discs in there, I would prefer to have an unbroken case.

Whenever Chast brought up the subject, they deflected, denied, re-routed the conversation. It's not that they were ignorant; they were just practiced at ignoring. Time has a way of pressing the issue, though, and after her father showed signs of senile dementia and her mother had a fall, they could no longer avoid the subject. To borrow a phrase from the author: This is a book about people who don't want to deal, being forced to deal.<br \/><br \/>The fact is that most of us in this country don't want to deal, which must have made this book a tough pitch to publishers. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if you're squirming a bit right now (&#34;Can't we read something more pleasant?&#34;). But in Chast's hands, the story charms the reader with dark wit and rueful honesty. Her sensibility manages to be really serious and really funny, sometimes all at once. When her father calls Chast to say that her mother took a bad fall and is refusing to go to the hospital, the take-charge mother butts in on the extension and announces, &#34;I wrote a poem about it.&#34;<br \/><br \/>Chast is unsparing in her portrayal of her parents, though it's softened by comedy and sympathy. &#34;Between their one-bad-thing-after-another lives, and the Depression, World War II, and the Holocaust, it was amazing that they weren't crazier than they were.&#34; Ultimately, she's harder on herself than anyone else, exposing her worries and shame as she attended to her parents' decline. As a result, we get a loving but clear-eyed picture of a couple's last days, and what it's like to care for them. What Chast has given us, then, is not only a good book, but an important one. Through CAN'T WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING MORE PLEASANT?, we can all begin to deal.","review_date":1420721183000}

Because it was patriotic, because the good guys win, because America was victorious!  There was none of this shades-of-grey, emotional hand-wringing, psychological soul-searchng introspection garbage -- just pick up a mother-effing gun and kill some aliens!  We didn't try to &#34;talk&#34; to them, we didn't send in then-Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton to seek a diplomatic solution.  The Marines weren't sent to Alien Cultural Awareness training  or given a 20-page booklet covering the Rules of Engagement, they went in to take care of business.<br \/><br \/>The brutal combat action sequences had the look and feel of Blackhawk Down; the depiction of the aliens, their weapons and ships were reminiscent of special effects used in District 9; and some elements from Independence Day.<br \/><br \/>The basic storyline was simple and uncluttered with irrelevant character-development, eye candy sex, love stories, car chases and similar filler baggage.  The bulk of the film was gritty scary urban warfare that was realistic but with minimal gore, except for the impromptu alien autopsy performed on a concrete floor with bare hands and a K-Bar.<br \/><br \/>Can't help but think this film was really an allegory for the Iraq \/ Afghanistan war -- only this time America was allowed to actually win!  Although this film was released long before the infamous 9\/11 Benghazi attack, it was kinda eerie watching a scene showing Marines sacrificing their lives trying to use a laser target designator to direct a laser-guided missile into the alien control center ship.","review_date":1421192084000}

(They read the scripts prepared for them, like other actors.) Falling ratings will cancel any show on TV, an actor must appeal to the audience. Will a death attract viewers? [Yes, it makes people happy it\u2019s not them.] People choose (indirectly) what will be shown on the news. Howard Beale says his show will be cancelled so he will \u201cblow his brains out\u201d next week! This attracts a lot of attention. [No \u201cGun Control\u201d then?] There are references to the events of that time - remember them? They review a news film of a bank robbery. Its \u201cauthentic\u201d! [Sensationalism? That attracts viewers.] Can they make a TV series from that? Will angry shows sell to the American public? Top management complains about the financial losses from news, and plan changes. [But doesn\u2019t this hook viewers into watching what comes afterward? Somebody has to pay for the shows on TV.]<br \/><br \/>Howard Beale speaks again, it going out live! Is it \u201cunconscionable\u201d? Things have changed since a corporation took over. [Would you like to work there?] Beale makes the new! Can a \u201cscreaming lunatic\u201d get a lot of attention? [Like those Talk Radio hosts? Yes!] They\u2019ll talk to Legal Affairs. \u201cThey\u2019ll give it a shot.\u201d An angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times? We learn about office politics. Can a psychic draw an audience? Does News involve sensationalism? What attracts an audience? Do people want to know the Truth? [Who defines that?] What do you know about the Talk Radio show hosts? Do the people who call in know what they are talking about? We see office politics again. \u201cFire or be thrown out!\u201d Beale preaches on TV again. \u201cI\u2019m mad as hell and I\u2019m not going to take this anymore!\u201d People are affected by this speech all over the country. It\u2019s now the #4 rated show! [Does this explain Hitler\u2019s appeal to an unhappy people?]<br \/><br \/>Will showing a terrorist group on TV attract viewers? Yes. [Will this satire ever become true?] Can that soothsayer show be a hit? Is there danger when people get their news from TV? Beale explains what TV does - entertainment. Illusions are not reality. \u201cTurn off your TV!\u201d Beale collapses. This show is very profitable now! \u201cExemplary.\u201d [Note the telephone booths on the street.] \u201cMisprision of a felony?\u201d The FBI does not want bank robbers shown on TV. [A bad example for copycats.] There is an emotional scene at home. [This pads out the story.] \u201cDoes she love you, Max?\u201d The \u201cEcumenical Liberation Front\u201d discusses their finances. [This is supposed to be a comedy.] Diana Christenson is applauded. \u201cThe #1 television show.\u201d \u201cEven better next year!\u201d<br \/><br \/>Beale speaks again about a corporate takeover. Could an oil country take over TV news and affect programming? [It\u2019s already happened.] Beale asks his viewers to send telegrams to the White House against the CCA deal. There is a meeting in New York. Jensen talks to Beale about \u201cecological balance\u201d and the natural order of things. The economy drives politics. Beale preaches the new message to his audience. Is \u201cdehumanization\u201d bad? This new message loses audience share. Max feels guilty about his new life. They plan to discharge Beale due to a falling audience. This affects Diana, and Max is leaving her. Does TV destroy its characters? [The story slows down now.] Do these characters seem real to you? Howard Beale will stay on the air, Jensen says so! [Who\u2019s crazy here?] They plan to make changes. \u201cThe Network can\u2019t be implicated.\u201d There is a shocking end to Beale\u2019s show! Killed because of low ratings?<br \/><br \/>The characters are based on real people observed in TV by the author. But the drama comes from the script. Was it overdone at times?

It perfectly blends history with modern day.<br \/><br \/>I'd recommend this to anyone 10 years and older.<br \/><br \/>I rate this book 5 stars because even though I was upset it had to end I couldn't put it down.

In them, I taunt baby-boomers who, having bought the LP, then bought the same album on CD in the 1980s, and within the last decade bought the digitally-remastered re-re-release, are now reviewing the &#62;Special 40th Anniversary Collector's Edition, Fully Remastered and With Previously Unreleased Bonus Tracks!&#60; re-re-re-release of the same album by the heros of their youth.<br \/><br \/>So these guys are buying the same album over and over, but if you're over the grand-old age of thirty and are no longer rebelling against anything, what choice do you have?  Each night at 12:30 a.m., I turn on the TV to see what musical act is featured on each of the network talk shows, and each night I'm appalled at how inept the acts are -- unoriginal, puerile and lacking in any technique. The music industry realizes that teens buy the most music (if they *buy* music), and kids aren't particularly interested in fine musicianship, artful chord changes or serious lyrics, so new music is limited to pretty boys,  &#34;alternative punk&#34; bands (he only knows how to strum two chords, but he's playing a Stratocaster!), and of course, The Slut of the Month performing in her underwear.<br \/><br \/>That's why, when I saw War on Drugs on one night's show, I rushed out and bought the CD the next day.  Finally! I thought, Grown-up music for grownups!  Unfortunately . . .<br \/><br \/>&#34;Red Eyes,&#34; which they usually perform when on TV, is a fine song, but the other material on the album is a huge disappointment. Following &#34;Red Eyes&#34; (that a pot reference?) is a slow song that is heart-stoppingly, breathtakingly<br \/>. . . . dull.<br \/>It's aptly titled, &#34;Suffering&#34; -- a long song in which nothing much happens. It's like listening to a faucet drip at night.<br \/><br \/>The other decent song on the album is &#34;An Ocean Between the Waves&#34; (deep, huh?), but it sounds remarkably like &#34;Red Eyes&#34; played at faster tempo. There's a sameness and lack of originality throughout the album.  Also throughout the album, but especially on &#34;Disappearing&#34; and the three following songs, the producer seems to have attempted to perform cosmetic surgery on a pig. They're weak songs, so he boosted the reverb and echo to the max, in an attempt to turn them into Pink Floyd. This has the paradoxical effect of transforming the songs from &#62;boring&#60; to &#62;annoying&#60;.<br \/><br \/>The album ends with &#34;In Reverse&#34; which is more of a recitation than a song.  You get the ambient effects of ocean waves on a beach, and Adam Granduciel goes into full-Dylan mode, bringing out every Dylan clich&eacute; until it sounds more like a Bob Dylan &#62;parody&#60; than Dylan influence.<br \/><br \/>I suppose I should quit griping and at least congratulate WoD for at least trying to make a serious album, and I suppose that if you get baked enough you'll be grooved by mellow sounds, dude.  It's not the return of Art Rock, because Rock implies that there's some excitement, and there's little of that here, just some shoegazing.<br \/><br \/>The blandness of WoD and their white-bread folk style makes it natural that many of these reviews compare them to ancient folk-rock acts. Some have said Dire Straits, others Mike Scott & the Waterboys, Bruce Springsteen (that's a stretch), so let me add my comparison -- Bruce Cockburn --  but then let me further recommend better contemporary bands that are attempting sophisticated music. You already know about Future Islands, but a pop band that has better songs is Foals' [[ASIN:B00ZG3VBKY What Went Down]], and an popular band that is far advanced beyond this one is [[ASIN:B00I8SJRH8 The Sam Roberts Band]].<br \/><br \/>I wish WoD well, because (for what it's worth) they're better than most of the bands who are granted TV appearances.  I hope that they eventually devise an album filled with outstanding material. . . but this ain't it.<br \/><br \/>ADDED JANUARY 28, 2015: I just saw Warren Drugs (whups, sorry, that's my pharmacy) on the Fallon show, performing &#34;Waves Between the Ocean,&#34; and it sounded pretty fine -- Granduciel playing some strong guitar in the manner of Lindsey-Buckingham. I have accordingly raised my rating by one star. When a band sounds better live than they do on record (as does the aforementioned [[ASIN:B00I8SJRH8 The Sam Roberts Band]]) it points to the poor quality of the recording as detracting from the band.<br \/><br \/>I yet maintain that &#34;Red Eyes&#34; and &#34;Ocean\/Waves&#34; are the only songs of interest on the album, and I recommend downloading them rather than purchasing the CD. Having only one or two satisfying songs on an album is hardly unusual with music today, and I think that bands should do more cover versions if they lack sufficient original material to fill an album. The Beatles, the Stones, the Doors and even Dylan included songs by other people on their early albums, but now, emerging bands are expected to all suddenly be great songwriters. This scheme of things does not seem to be working as well as the old system of professional songwriters (those in Tin-Pan Alley, the Brill Building or the Nashville Songwriters) supplying the songs.. . . but this ain't it.<br \/><br \/>ADDED JANUARY 28, 2015: I just saw Warren Drugs (whups, sorry, that's my pharmacy) on the Fallon show, performing &#34;Waves Between the Ocean,&#34; and it sounded pretty fine -- Granduciel playing some strong guitar in the manner of Lindsey-Buckingham.

I kind of understand and in some ways do not understand. It has that emotional strength with complex characters in an imaginative future world that the Hugo loves. However the beginning is clunky with poor transitions between back story and present. It only picks up past the half way point. In addition, The revenge plot seems far too easy. Finally, this future world is amazingly vague on details giving it a lack of depth. By the  way using one gender in speach, but seeming to indicate everyone is female is unnecessarily confusing. I find it different, but lacking greatness and will not be reading the sequel.","review_date":1421312296000}

This is the third installment in her Bared to You trilogy, which follows the overly sexual lives of Gideon Cross and Eva Tramell. Although I wasn\u2019t able to write posts about the preceding books in this series, rest assured I ate them both up. Gideon Cross is the powerful multi-millionaire control freak with a dark past, while Eva Tramell is the sexual damaged 20-something trying to start a new life in New York. Upon their meeting, both Cross and Tramell are instantly drawn to each other. Now in we jump to the third book where they are finally getting married.<br \/> A lot of people have compared this series to the ultra famous Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. I can see the similarities, but there are some unique things about this book and these characters that make this book feel real and relatable. Cross and Tramell have \u201cvanilla sex\u201d. They just have a lot of it. I\u2019d say a lot more than the average couple. I actually liked the fact that this couple has \u201cregular\u201d sex and it\u2019s not all about bondage and whips and red rooms. It makes their romance a lot more relatable. The only thing I didn\u2019t like about their sex is that they use it as a form of communication, which is clearly an unhealthy way for a couple to communicate.<br \/>Both Cross and Tramell have really messed up pasts. I think Sylvia Day\u2019s decision to tackle child molestation and how it affects both men and women was a brave one and I commend her for doing that. It makes me feel like this book is about more than just sex, which I felt with \u201cFifty\u201d. Giving both characters a depressing past really adds depth to the story and helps the reader understand why these people are the way they are.<br \/>I appreciate the fact that Eva is a strong independent woman. Being a strong independent woman myself I can relate to a woman who knows what she wants and isn\u2019t afraid to ask for it; A woman who doesn\u2019t compromise her independence for a man.<br \/>Overall, I\u2019d give this book 5\/5 stars and I\u2019d definitely recommend this series to anyone who likes this \u201cmature audience\u201d style of writing. I can\u2019t wait to start the 4th and 5th book of this series!br \/>Overall, I\u2019d give this book 5\/5 stars and I\u2019d definitely recommend this series to anyone who likes this \u201cmature audience\u201d style of writing.

Along the way you encounter heroes and villains, discover the the modern computer, witness exploits of war and pure genius. Singh tells the history of cryptology framing the story in the to and fro battle between code breakers and code makers. The core of the book is its technical explanation of the growth of cryptology from arcane science to its current everyday use. This highly readable gem unmasks the fun in cryptology and tells the story of the rock star scientists who made impossible breakthroughs. The complexity and technical nature of the book peaks at the end which some may find overwhelming but Singh did well not to shy away as all the knowledge he shares is invaluable in order to understand the significance of the final chapter of the book which is the real highlight.    The last chapter brings us to the current state of affairs in the ongoing battle between code makers and code breakers and the pursuit for the perfect code. If Singh stopped there I would still recommend the Code Book. However he delivers a lovely little finale in his discussion of cryptology and privacy. Which post-Snowden is an issue that most can no longer hide from and gives the book a highly relevant finish.    All in all Singh does a brilliant job of bringing cryptology out of its creepy sounding shadows and into the light whilst giving the reader an understanding of it's extreme relevance in our modern technological society. The book was well complimented with a brilliant 8-part youtube series entitled \\\\\"gambling with secrets\\\\\" that effortlessly explains all the theory that you would need to enjoy this book with great visuals.    The one criticism I would make is I felt Singh left a lot of value on the table after he introduces the idea of cryptographically coded money but left the subject of crypto-currencies such as bitcoin untouched. Perhaps this will be an addition in a later edition.Pick it up if you have any interest in cryptography, would like some complimentary reading to privacy issues, the origins of the computer, or you're just looking for a good read in the area of science.    edit: I experienced no problem with any graphics reading this book on the kindle app for mac and iPad. There is small error with a graphic for fig. 64 where 99+13 should be 99\/13.","review_date":1421154715000}

These headphones are really good for the price, Highly Reccommended!<br \/><br \/>What I Like : 3D soundstage, Great treble that the Sennheisers dont have, very controlled bass (with a slight roll off), and okay mids.<br \/><br \/>What I dislike: The mids can use improvement in clarity and naturalness, especially vocals, and the soundstage is all over the place (not natural) good for movies. These can be tone fatiguing after 30-60 minutes.<br \/><br \/>The Sennheisers have better vocal clarity (both momentums and HD600s), the treble is more polite but equally better. If the AKG had more vocal clarity and a little more realistic bass it would be a fairly easy decision. Over all the HD600s sound more coherent.<br \/><br \/>Get the K702 if you want a 3D sound and amazing audio for the price. These highly require amplification, I prefer the Objective amp + ODAC.","review_date":1421518258000}

Marvel is really a great production company, everything they do just turns to gold.  Chris Pratt is the next American acting superstar, Zoe Saldana is great and funny, and nothing beats Bradley Cooper as the Raccoon.  There is also a warm spot in my heart fro Groot, who shines as the movie goes on.  And it's a Marvel film, so don't forget to stay until the last frame goes by.","review_date":1420672604000}

Take it from a cat who was THERE for the Halcyon days of PETER GREEN'S FLEETWOOD MAC or CAPTAIN BEYOND, these young 'uns have delivered, in spades, and this is only their debut long player. It's all here, chops, vision, atmosphere, and that hard to truly define &#34;vibe&#34;, you just KNOW it when you hear it, and it's all in the grooves, only folks who truly CAN channel the greats can get this close, I was there the night FLEETWOOD MAC cut the live SHRINE '69 platter, this comes as close as anyone will EVER get to nailing that vibe, like a 2014 version of THE MAC'S &#34;THEN PLAY ON&#34; LP. A LOT of younger bands worship at this alter, probably because as many younger cats have told me that modern Rock just doesn't get it. To illustrate the point, I was standing outside a BEST BUY store a few years back when Zep's &#34;HOW THE WEST WAS WON&#34; thingy came out, got to talking to a kid about having SEEN Zep in 1968, and so many other times, and he said &#34;well, even I know that NONE of the bands from my generation will EVER touch Zep or the SABS or anything like that&#34;, I had to tell him,  &#34;well, son, you're right, but since you GET that, you're way ahead of the game&#34;. So...get ahead of the game, buy this, slap it on, adjust your wig, and return to the time when true GIANTS bestrode the earth, this IS that good, I have to say that there are MORE good young bands out now then at any other time in YEARS, and THIS is going to be one that will hold up and TESTIFY.","review_date":1421949551000}

As an in-depth look at a compulsive serial killer who nevertheless tries his best to stick to his moral code of only killing murderers who deserve to die, Dexter actually comes across as a decent person.  Very good plotting.  You can never be sure what will happen next from one season to the other.","review_date":1420992653000}
